            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated and passionate 3rd year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
                With a strong foundation in programming languages such as C and beginner-level proficiency in Python, SQLite, MongoDB, 
                and Web Development, I am well-equipped to tackle diverse technical challenges. My hands-on experience in creating 
                basic AI models using TensorFlow further underscores my capability and enthusiasm for the field. I am eager to leverage 
                my knowledge and skills in a dynamic internship role, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to 
                grow as a future AI and ML engineer.
